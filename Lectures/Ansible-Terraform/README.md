# Overview
In this lecture we're discussing Ansible and Terraform, two very important tools when it comes to configuration management and infrastructure as code.
In this section of the course you'd find examples of using Ansible:
- using ad-hoc commands
- using playbooks 
- using playbooks with roles

as well as a simple example of using Terraform
